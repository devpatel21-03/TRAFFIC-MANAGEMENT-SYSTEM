# TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
 Managing traffic efficiently is a growing challenge in busy cities. Traditional traffic lights run on fixed timers, often leading to unnecessary delays and wasted timeâ€”especially when some lanes are crowded and others are nearly empty. Our project aims to solve this by building an Adaptive Traffic Signal Timer that adjusts the green light duration based on real-time traffic conditions.  We use live images from CCTV cameras and apply a machine learning model (YOLO) to detect and count vehicles like cars, bikes, buses, trucks, and rickshaws. This information is then fed into a smart algorithm that calculates how long each signal should stay green, depending on how crowded each lane is. To keep things fair, the system makes sure no lane gets ignored for too long.  To show how this works in real life, we also built a simulation using Pygame that displays a virtual intersection with vehicles moving in different directions. It shows how our system adjusts signal timings to match traffic flow, unlike the traditional one-size-fits-all approach.  In short, this project combines technology and practicality to create smarter traffic lights that can help reduce congestion, save time, and make our roads more efficient.
